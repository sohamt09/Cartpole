# Cartpole
## This is the code which has been implemented in google colab,to get the output.


The Cartpole environment is one of the simplest MDPs. It is extremely low dimensional, with a four-dimensional observation space and only two actions. The goal of this exercise is to implement several RL algorithm in order to get practical experience with such methods.

The small size and simplicity of this environment makes it is possible to run very quick experiments.

Cartpole - known also as an Inverted Pendulum is a pendulum with a center of gravity above its pivot point. Itâ€™s unstable, but can be controlled by moving the pivot point under the center of mass. The goal is to keep the cartpole balanced by applying appropriate forces to a pivot point.
